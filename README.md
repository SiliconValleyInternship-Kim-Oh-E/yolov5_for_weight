Contains code modified **yolov5*** to suit purpose of our project.
when we trained/testesd recognition model, we cloned this repository.

- **best.pt**: Trained model. Can get this file from train_and_test.ipynb.

- **detect.py**: Face recognition in video with trained model.  
We add more features ㅡ Confidence thresholding & Calculating appearance timeline of each character 


Currently, the same content has been incorporated into backend/yolov5
